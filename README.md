# eslint

The pre-configured ESLint config is a compilation of best practices for advanced developers - it turns off some popular rules to provide more flexibility.

This config includes some stylistic rules such as `semi`, `indent`, and `quotes`, which may not align with everyone's preferences.

If you desire even more flexibility, you can disable rules you don't like or fork this repository.

## Usage

- Create `.eslintrc` file
- Put `{ "extends": ["plugin:@react-neat/recommended"] }` line to the file
